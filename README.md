# Project-1
This project is a Python-based application that retrieves daily temperature data for a specific city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The script stores the data in a CSV file, processes it using Pandas, and calculates the daily average, minimum, and maximum temperatures. Finally, it generates a basic HTML report summarizing the findings.
